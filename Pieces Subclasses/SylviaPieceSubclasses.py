# I don't think we can write what each piece needs to do before
# establishing the coordinates system in the GUI. Also, we need
# to come up with a way of knowing when pieces are clicked on to
# move â€” whether that be making each graphic a button or
# something. She also wants one author per module, so we should
# split off. I'm fine doing either I guess.
